/*    Approach:
    We will find factorial of the length of the string
            we will start with 0 and iterate till fact(length) -1 ,each time we will divide the value by i
    i will start from string length and each time will be decremented by 1 until we reach 1
    we will print the character at the position which we get as the remainder,remove it after that
    and the next dividend will be the quotient here ,in this way the inner loop will continue ,outer loop will drive which
    number we need to start dividing which we derive from 0...........1,2,3,....fact(length-1)*/
